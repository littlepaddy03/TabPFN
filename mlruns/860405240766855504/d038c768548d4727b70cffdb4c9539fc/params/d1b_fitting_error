CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 16.91 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.68 GiB of which 12.69 GiB is free. Process 123674 has 10.99 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 10.66 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 30.87 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
