CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 12.68 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.68 GiB of which 10.62 GiB is free. Process 106939 has 13.06 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 12.76 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 4.28 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
